# IRZA ZAKARIA / SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

A static engineering portfolio for a Platform / Site Reliability Engineer.

Platform engineering, reliability, Linux, networking, and tools built to
understand how systems behave when things go wrong.

## Stack

- React + TypeScript (strict) built with Vite
- React Router for the single page and the not-found route
- Lucide icons (`lucide-react`)
- Plain CSS with CSS Modules and design tokens (`src/styles/tokens.css`)
- ESLint + Prettier, Vitest + React Testing Library
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for free static hosting

No backend, database, CMS, or paid service.

## Scripts

| `npm run dev`          | Start the dev server                      |
| `npm run build`        | Type-check and produce a production build |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview the production build locally      |
| `npm run typecheck`    | Type-check only                           |
| `npm run lint`         | Run ESLint                                |
| `npm run format`       | Check formatting with Prettier            |
| `npm run format:write` | Apply Prettier formatting                 |
| `npm run test`         | Run the test suite once                   |
| `npm run test:watch`   | Run tests in watch mode                   |

Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test` before committing.

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/     Reusable UI (Header, Footer, Section, layout)
  content/        Editable site content — per-language dictionaries
  i18n/           Language context, provider, and switch wiring
  pages/          HomePage and the not-found page
  styles/         Design tokens and global styles
  test/           Test setup
  App.tsx         Route definitions
  main.tsx        App entry + router
```

Content is kept out of components. To change what the site says, edit the files
in `src/content/` rather than the UI.

## Editing content

The site is a single page: a hero plus three capability sections (CORE OPS,
PLATFORM LAB, INFRA) and a contact block. It is bilingual (English and
Indonesian). Content is authored per language and must satisfy the shared
`ContentDictionary` type, so a missing translation fails the type check instead
of silently rendering blank.

- `src/content/en.ts` — English content.
- `src/content/id.ts` — Indonesian content.
- `src/content/types.ts` — shared content types.
- `src/content/index.ts` — language registry and `getContent(language)`.
- `src/content/contact.ts` — contact links from environment variables.

When you edit one language file, mirror the change in the other. Each file
contains the hero copy, focus areas, the three capability sections, and UI
strings. The header identity and footer text are intentionally identical in both
files — they stay in English regardless of the selected language.

The language switch (top-right) is a small context provider
(`src/i18n/`). It stores the choice in `localStorage` and falls back to the
browser language. No URL changes are involved, so it works unchanged on
GitHub Pages.

**Only publish verified, non-confidential information.** Nothing is presented as
finished unless it actually is.

### Contact details (kept out of the repo)

Public contact links are not stored in the repository. They are read from
build-time environment variables, so the source can stay clean:

| Variable                | Example                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL`    | `name@example.com`               |
| `VITE_CONTACT_GITHUB`   | `https://github.com/your-handle` |
| `VITE_CONTACT_LINKEDIN` | `https://linkedin.com/in/you`    |

Any variable that is unset is simply omitted — the site never shows a fake
address.

- **Locally:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in (`.env` is
  git-ignored).
- **In CI:** add them under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
  Variables** (the _Variables_ tab, since they are public). The workflow passes
  them to the build.

Note: environment variables avoid committing the values, but they are still
inlined into the shipped site, where visitors can read them. Only put contact
details you are happy to publish.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds, lints, type-checks, and
tests the site, then deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

Manual setup required once, in the repository settings:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually). The site publishes to
   `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

### Base path

The build reads the `BASE_URL` environment variable. The workflow sets it to
`/<repository-name>/`, which is correct for a project site such as
`https://<user>.github.io/engineering-portofolio/`.

Change it to `/` if you deploy to:

- a user/org site (`https://<user>.github.io`), or
- a custom domain.

Client-side routing on Pages is handled by `public/404.html` plus a small
restore script in `index.html`. If you set `BASE_URL` to `/`, also change
`pathSegmentsToKeep` in `public/404.html` from `1` to `0`.

### Custom Node version

`.nvmrc` pins Node 22. If your environment reports unsupported-engine warnings,
upgrade to Node 22.13+ or 24.

## Deploying to Vercel

The site is also deployed to Vercel (project `seronzs-projects/engineering-portofolio`),
connected to this GitHub repository so pushes to `main` deploy to production.

- `vercel.json` sets the Vite framework preset, the `dist` output directory, and
  a catch-all rewrite to `/index.html` so client-side routes resolve on deep links.
- On Vercel the build runs with the default Vite base path (`/`), so do **not**
  set `BASE_URL` there — that variable is only used by the GitHub Pages workflow.
- Contact links come from the `VITE_CONTACT_GITHUB`, `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL`, and
  (optional) `VITE_CONTACT_LINKEDIN` environment variables, set in the Vercel
  project for Production, Preview, and Development.

### Custom domain (`irzazakaria.is-a.dev`)

The custom domain is a free subdomain from [is-a.dev](https://www.is-a.dev),
which works by adding `domains/irzazakaria.json` to the `is-a-dev/register`
repository via a pull request. That file declares a `CNAME` record pointing to
`cname.vercel-dns.com`, which Vercel then verifies and provisions a certificate
for automatically.
